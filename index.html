<br> My full name is OLuwatoni Jemima OLafunmiloye. That's 27 letteres which happens to be the date of my birthday, November 27th.
<br> I love musicals <br> I also love food, but then again who doesn't am I right. I don't just love eating I love cooking it too. <br> I love anything sci-fi, but not anything that like creepy sci-fi. I get scared easily. <br> I'm not a huge fan of reading novels, buty I will tolerate them. Comic books are my thing, though. Anything superhero or superherione (is that a thing?) interests me.

<p2> <br> I don't like sports. I do not enjoy running. While others focus on the wind in their hair and breathing, I'm mostly focusing on how tired I am and if that's the blood from my lungs in tasting in my mouth.  </p2>
<p3> <br>I somewhat like to travel. It depends on where I'm going really. Like if it's somewhere hot/near the equator then I wouldn't want to go there. But if it's somewhere warm like somewhere in Europe then sure I'll go. </p3>
