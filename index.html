<h1> First Repository </h1>
<p1> <br> I have no idea why I chose the name of the repository to be "Furry Garbanzo Bean" but it was suggested (well I added the bean part because if I didn't it would sound weird). <br> </p1>
<p2> <br> I also have no idea what a repository is. Like is it a webpage and if so why can't they just say webpage. And if this is supposed to be a page about furry garbanzo beans I gto nothing. Sorry to disappoint those fellow bean lovers. <br> </p2>
<p3> <br> Here's some things about me: I am obssessed with musicals. Well not really obssessed per say, I just really really really really like them alot. <br> I also love food, but then again who doesn't am I right. I don't just love eating I love cooking it too. <br> I love anything sci-fi, but not anything that like creepy sci-fi. I get scared easily. I even close my eyes and cover my ears during horror movie COMMERCIALS. <br> I'm not a huge fan of reading novels, buty I will tolerate them. Comic books are my thing, though. Anything superhero or superherione (is that a thing?) interests me. </p3>

<p4> <br> I don't like sports. I do not enjoy running. While others focus on the wind in their hair and breathing, I'm mostly focusing on how tired I am and if that's the blood from my lungs in tasting in my mouth.  <p4>
