<h1> First Repository </h1>
<p1>There's music to play, places to go, people to see! <br> Everything, for you and me! <br> Life's a ball, if only you know it.<br> And it's all, just waiting for you.<br> Your alive, so come on and show it. <br> There's such a lot of livin to do. <br></p1>
<p2> <br> I have no idea why I chose the nane of the repository to be "Furry Garbanzo Bean" but it was suggested (well I added the bean part because if i didn't it would sound weird). </p2>
<p3> <br> I also have no idea what a repository is. Like is it a webpage and if so why can't they just say webpage. And if this is supposed to be a page about surry garbanzo beans I gto nothing. Sorry to disappoint those fellow bean lovers. <br> </p3>
